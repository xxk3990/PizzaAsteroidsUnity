ASTEROIDS PIZZA!
DESCRIPTION
●	Asteroids type game where the user shoots bullets at asteroids. In this version, it is a slice of pizza shooting lasers at pepperoni.
  ○	When the bullet collides with the asteroid, the asteroid breaks into two pieces and the user’s points go up by 20. When the user hits one of the smaller ones, it disappears and the user gets 50 points.
●	Circle collision detection for when bullet hits asteroid and when vehicle hits them
  ○	When the ship hits an asteroid the number of lives decreases by one
  ○	Brief time of immunity where the user cannot be hit, ship flashes back and forth between 100% and 25% opacity during this time.
●	Game Over scene which is activated when the number of lives hits zero. It has a button to play asteroids again, and when you click it will load the original scene, with lives and points reset. If you eliminate all the small asteroids, more big ones will just spawn. FUNCTIONALITY
●	Controls
  ○	Up arrow key to accelerate, release to decelerate
  ○	Left/right arrow keys to rotate ship
  ○	Spacebar to fire lasers

All the code for this is my own, except for the vehicle acceleration, which I got from an in-class demo.
