## Xander Kaylan | Asteroids Documentation Page
Pizza Asteroids with original C# code and unity build.
## ASTEROIDS PIZZA!
### Description
<br>
Version of Unity: 2018 3.7f1
<br>
<br>
●	Used Unity 2D to create Asteroids type game where the user shoots bullets at asteroids. In this version, it is a slice of pizza shooting lasers at pepperoni.
<br>
	When the bullet collides with the asteroid, the asteroid breaks into two pieces and the user’s points go up by 20. When the user hits one of the smaller ones, it disappears and the user gets 50 points.
	<br>
	Hand coded Circle collision detection for when bullet hits asteroid and when vehicle hits asteroids
<br>
	  When the ship hits an asteroid the number of lives decreases by one
  <br>
	    Brief time of immunity where the user cannot be hit, ship flashes back and forth between 100% and 25% opacity during this 
    time.
	<br>
	<br>
● Game Over scene which is activated when the number of lives hits zero. It has a button to play again, and when you click it will load the original scene, with lives and points reset. If you eliminate all the small asteroids, more big ones will just spawn.
